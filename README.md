Read the File and Key Features of the Script
This script is designed to extract and reformat sensitive information (like URLs, usernames, and passwords) from specific log files. Below is an explanation of how it works and its key features.

Key Features
Automated File Traversal:
The script automatically scans the selected directory and subdirectories for target files, reducing manual effort.

Pattern Matching with Regular Expressions:
Extracts data using robust regular expressions, ensuring flexibility and accuracy.

Dynamic Output File Naming:
The output file name is based on the input directory's name, making it easy to identify the source of extracted data.

Error Resilience:
Gracefully handles errors, such as file encoding issues or missing patterns, and logs the errors for debugging.

User-Friendly Interface:
Utilizes Tkinter to provide a graphical interface for directory selection, making it accessible to non-technical users.

Scalability:
Can handle large datasets with multiple subdirectories and files.

Formatted and Readable Output:
Outputs credentials in a structured format (URL|username|password) that can be directly used or parsed by other tools.

Cross-Platform Compatibility:
Built using standard Python libraries (os, re, tkinter), ensuring compatibility across Windows, macOS, and Linux.
